// list for port 53 use
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

// disable port 53 from system resolve
// First do these...
1) systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
2) systemctl stop systemd-resolved

// broke internet after port 53 changes
// only check the file below don't edit it
// sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
// edit the file below (DNSStubListener=no) its there just change yes to no
3) sudo nano edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
// restart service
4) service systemd-resolved restart

When the Port 53 is already in Use, you can check this with this command (ubuntu):
Port 53 is being used at your host machine, that's why you can not bind 53 to host.
To find what is using port 53 you can do: sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
I'm a 99.9% sure that systemd-resolved is what is listening to port 53.
To solve that you need to edit the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and uncomment DNSStubListener and change it to no, so it looks like this: DNSStubListener=no
After that reboot your system or restart the service with service systemd-resolved restart
